# Automotive Cyber Physical System (CPS) Bluetooth Server

This server is a TCP/IP server that acts as a middle man between <a href="https://github.com/tenbergen/CSC480-22S"> ANKI SDK for Java </a> and the <a href="https://github.com/anki/drive-sdk">firmware</a> on a ANKI Drive device. This server is meant to replace the node.js bluetooth server that comes with the ANKI SDK for Java. The server is a piece of research software that is meant to pair with <a href="https://github.com/tenbergen/Automotive-CPS"> Automotive-CPS</a>.
